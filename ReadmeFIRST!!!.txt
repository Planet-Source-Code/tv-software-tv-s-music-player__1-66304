Before you open the project you need to download some files :
-The path Skin with the skin files
-The dll's for ripping a cd

You can download it at http://vb.download.tvsoftware.nl/Skin_and_dlls.zip

Unzip it at the same location as the musicplayer(MusicPlayer.zip) code, and it should work now!

The skijnpackmaker(SkinPackMaker.zip) should work without downloading extra files!
